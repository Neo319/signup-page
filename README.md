# signup-page
Sign-up form page made alongside The Odin Project.

This project makes use of html and css to create a realistic sign-up page for websites, organizations, etc.
Though rudimentary, this project involves the use of CSS pseudoclasses to perform a basic client-side validation.
The "Create Account" button is intentionally unable to do anything, as there is no website for it to use. 

For my project, I also implemented responsive design techniques that could be used for mobile as well as desktop viewports.
